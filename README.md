### User Stories

As a user:

- I want to be able to create an account
- I want to be able to sign in with my account
- I want to be able to change my password
- I want to be able to sign out of my account
- I want to have a list of all my teas
- I want to be able to add new teas to the list
- I want to be able to use a timer for the steep time
- I want to click a button next to a tea and have the timer load that tea’s steep time
- I want to be able to update a tea on the list
- I want to be able to delete teas from the list


#### Stretch Goals:

- Sort teas by type (black, green, white, other)
- Add another table with about 15 common teas, and the user can select from those teas to add to their list.  The user can not CRUD on this table. (seed data)
